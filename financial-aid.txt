I am now a junior in Da Nang University of Science and Technology, Viet Nam, and my major is Information Technology. I had to apply for some scholarship programs to pay for course fee in the university. Meanwhile , I also had a part-time job in a coffee shop as a waiter, and my wages are used to pay for my accommodation, transportation and studying material like notebooks, circuit boards , arduinos and I barely have enough spare money for emergency cases.
Recently, I have just quited my job at the coffee shop to look for another part-time job with more flexible working time to fit my school schedule as well as my own AI studying schedule. Eventually , I found a new job at a school's cafeteria. It has been the toughest decision because the monthly income remains a half. Thus, it is tougher for me to spend money wisely so that I can fulfill my basic needs. It is really impossible for me to pay for this course.



As I did some researches on the Internet, industrial revolution 4.0 has come to my country, Vietnam, and changed many aspects of life and working methods, in which artificial intelligence stays at the central of the revolution. As a worker in technology field in the future, I need to catch up with time and do not allow myself to be old-fashion. Thus, I aim to improve my skills related to artificial intelligence area and be a part of my country's development. As I mentioned above, I have planned my own AI studying schedule as well as what I will gain after that. Moreover, I also intend to go into Machine Learning field so I really need to enhance my Al knowledge from basic to advance. Besides, I have taken few courses about Machine Learning in university before and had quite good background in coding experience. Enrolling in this course would be my next crucial step in my plan and it could bring my work into progress as well as equip me with knowledge that would be essential for my AI career in the future.
